## Overview

[Providence](https://github.com/mrzzy/providence) simplifies personal finance management by integrating diverse data sources into a unified pipeline and visualizing financial metrics through an intuitive dashboard. The V2 redesign prioritizes affordability and ease of maintenance, addressing challenges from the initial implementation.

## Key Features

- **Automated ELT Pipeline**:
  - Supports data extraction from YNAB, SimplyGo, and UOB bank statements.
  - Integrates data into a dimensional model for cohesive analysis.
- **Visual Finance Insights**:
  - Superset-powered dashboard provides insights on budgeting, spending, and trends.
- **Low-Cost Architecture**:
  - Combines serverless compute, free-tier managed services, and lightweight storage solutions for minimal operational costs.

## Learning Points from V2

- **Improved Workflow Automation**:
  - Managed services (e.g., Prefect) reduced the effort of patching and maintaining infrastructure.
  - Azure Container Instances simplified compute scaling without the overhead of Kubernetes.
- **Lowered Cloud Costs**:
  - Replacing AWS Redshift with MotherDuck DuckDB dramatically reduced analytical query expenses.
  - Leveraging free-tier options in Backblaze B2 and Apache Superset eliminated baseline costs for personal usage.
- **Optimized Architecture**:
  - Transitioned to a single-node database architecture better suited to modest data volumes.
  - Adopted DBT Core and DuckDB for efficient and affordable data modeling and transformation.

## Architecture

Providence V2 balances cost efficiency and performance using managed and serverless solutions:

- **Compute**: Azure Container Instances for on-demand processing.
- **Storage**: Backblaze B2 for raw data and MotherDuck DuckDB for analytics.
- **Orchestration**: Prefect for managing data workflows.
- **Visualization**: Apache Superset for financial dashboards.

## Outcome

Providence V2 addresses the challenges of high costs and maintenance overhead from its predecessor by leveraging lightweight, scalable solutions tailored for personal use. The redesigned architecture ensures sustainability and simplicity, making it ideal for a single engineer's budget and workload.
