## Overview

As part of an assignment for Database-System Principles module, I designed and implemented a simple [B+Tree database system in C++](https://github.com/mrzzy/ntu-sc3020/tree/main/project1) to store and perform an aggregation query over NBA game statistics.
The system consists of two main components:

- **Storage** parsing Tab Seperated Values (TSV) data file, organising data into columar format sorted by key and storing it into fixed-sized data blocks on disk.
- **Indexing** built B+Tree index with bulk loading to enable fast range queries on the `FG_PCT_home` attribute.
  The project involves parsing raw TSV data, storing it in a columnar format

The final implementation demonstrates the performance benefits of using a B+Tree for range queries compared to brute-force linear scans.

## Key Features

1. **Storage Component**:

   - Data records were stored in fixed-size blocks aligned with the underlying filesystem block size for efficient disk I/O.
   - Data records were stored **sorted** to allow for efficient binary search record querying.
   - Columnar (Structure of Arrays) record storage format was used to improve cache locality by colocating multiple values of the same field.
     This improved the overall performance of the aggregation query performed on the data.
   - Data blocks were chained with a next pointer to handle data record overflows beyond a single block.

2. **Indexing Component**:

   - A B+Tree index was built on the `FG_PCT_home` attribute to enable fast range queries used to collect data records for the final aggregation.
   - The B+Tree is built from sorted data records level by level using **bulk loading**.

3. **Query Performance**:
   - The system supports the aggregation query using both brute-force linear scan and index lookup methods.
   - A `SpyStore` wraps a real `Store` implementation to used to collect storage performance metrics such the no. of data / index block accesses.

#### Challenges & Learning Points

1. **C++ Complexity**:

   - As someone new to C++, I faced challenges with memory management and debugging undefined behaviors. For instance, an off-by-one error in a loop caused memory corruption that manifested in unrelated parts of the code. Using tools like Valgrind was crucial for identifying and fixing these issues.

2. **Design Tradeoffs**:

   - **Columnar Storage**: While columnar storage improved query performance by leveraging CPU cache locality, it added complexity to the implementation, especially when handling missing values and data alignment.
   - **Bulk Loading**: Bulk loading the B+Tree was efficient but required careful handling of sorted data and node splitting. Balancing memory usage and disk I/O was a key consideration.
   - **Single-User Assumption**: Simplifying the system by assuming a single-user environment allowed me to focus on core functionality but limited the system's scalability for concurrent access.

3. **Debugging and Testing**:
   - Debugging C++ code, especially memory-related issues, was time-consuming despite my use of the GDB debugger. I learned the importance of writing modular, testable code and using tools like Valgrind to catch memory errors early.
   - Testing edge cases, such as missing values and duplicate keys, was critical to ensuring the robustness of the system.

#### Outcome

The same aggregation query over `FG_PCT_home` is executed with brute-force scan & index lookup methods to compare their performance characteristics:

| Search Method      | Index Blocks Accessed | Data Blocks Accessed | Retrieval Time (Âµs) |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| B+ Tree Search     | 1                     | 57                   | 276                 |
| Brute-force Search | 0                     | 437                  | 1935                |

The indexed query was ~7x faster than the brute-force scan, accessing only 57 data blocks compared to 437.
This highlights the importance of indexing in database systems.
